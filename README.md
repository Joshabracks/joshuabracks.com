This is a simple website with info about myself that doubles as a demo for the **State Street** SPA framework.

Tools that were used in the creation of this website include: 
- [State Street](https://github.com/Joshabracks/state-street): An open-source single page application framework designed for ease-of-use (that I built myself)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework (that I wanted to try out and ended up liking a lot)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en): an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications
