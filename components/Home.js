            <div class="mt-5">The story about how I became a software engineer is likely more common than I'd like to believe it's at least a little bit interesting.</div>
            <div class="mt-5"><span class="font-bold">Back in the day</span>, when I was fresh out of highschool and had to choose a focus of study, my father told me, <span class="text-0">"Son. You should study programming!". </span> So, of course I decided to study <span class="line-through text-2 mr-1.5">art</span>graphic design. It was a compromise that ultimately led to a long career as an illustrator and web designer, which ultimately led to... Software Engineering (aka programming). </div>
            <div class="mt-5">In the, just about two decades that followed my education in art, graphic and web design, I had a rather eclectic set of careers that - in the millenial spirit - overlapped quite a bit.  As a freelance designer, I illustrated text books, built web sites, created graphcis for film and television, learned and applied special effects for youtube and did quite a bit more.  I also made some extra cash on the side working as a musician and actor... I also picked up a trade in the medical field as a dental assistant and somehow ended up managing a clinic.</div>
            <div class="mt-5">Somewhere along the way, my skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript weren't cutting it in web design.  My clients were asking for more and more functionality, so I did what any self-repecting freelancer would do and I joined a coding bootcamp, expecing to learn just enough to keep up with the increasing complexity of client demends.  Instead, I came out of the bootcamp entirely enamoured with software development and dove in hard.  I decided it was time for a career change and, in the past 5 years I've worked for a startup that got bought out by PayPal, got laid off by PayPal, worked as CTO for another startup that got bought out by another startup, started several projects (finished some), one of which is the <a class="text-3 hover:text-0 mr-3" href="https://github.com/Joshabracks/State-Street"> Single Page Application Framework that this webpage is built on.</a>  I also built some video games for fun and am working on considerably larger project that's a bit more hush, hush (at least until the beta drops).
